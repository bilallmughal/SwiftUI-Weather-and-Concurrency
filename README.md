# Weather & AQI App

A modern iOS application built with SwiftUI that provides real-time weather information and air quality data. The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern and leverages Swift's latest concurrency features.

## Features

- üìç Location-based weather and AQI data
- üîç City search functionality
- üå°Ô∏è Detailed weather information
  - Temperature
  - Feels like temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed and direction
  - Atmospheric pressure
- üí® Comprehensive Air Quality data
  - EPA Air Quality Index
  - PM2.5 and PM10 levels
  - Ozone (O3) levels
  - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels
  - Visual AQI status indicators
  - 24-hour PM2.5 trend graph
- üìä Interactive charts for AQI trends
- üé® Clean, modern UI with dynamic themes
- üîÑ Automatic location updates

## Technical Features

- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Charts**: SwiftUI Charts
- **Concurrency**: Swift's modern async/await pattern
- **Actor Model**: For thread-safe state management
- **Location Services**: CoreLocation integration
- **API Integration**: WeatherAPI.com
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Requirements

- iOS 16.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.5+
- WeatherAPI.com API Key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-aqi-app.git
```

2. Open the project in Xcode
```bash
cd weather-aqi-app
open Weather\ MVVM.xcodeproj
```

3. Add your WeatherAPI.com API key in `Weather_MVVMApp.swift`
```swift
private let weatherService = WeatherService(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

4. Build and run the project

## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern with the following components:

### Models
- `WeatherResponse`: Weather data model
- `AQIResponse`: Air Quality data model
- Various supporting models for detailed data representation

### Views
- `MainTabView`: Main container view with tabs
- `WeatherView`: Weather information display
- `AQIView`: Air Quality information and charts
- Various supporting views for UI components

### ViewModels
- `WeatherViewModel`: Weather data management
- `AQIViewModel`: AQI data management

### Services
- `WeatherService`: API communication using async/await
- `LocationService`: Location management with actor-based concurrency
- `LocationManager`: Main actor wrapper for location updates

## Key Features Implementation

### Location Services
```swift
actor LocationService {
    // Thread-safe location handling
    // Continuation-based async location requests
    // Main actor proxying for UI updates
}
```

### Weather Data Fetching
```swift
actor WeatherService {
    // Async API communication
    // Error handling
    // Response parsing
}
```

### AQI Visualization
```swift
struct AQIView {
    // SwiftUI Charts integration
    // Real-time updates
    // Interactive elements
}
```

## API Integration

The app uses [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) for weather and air quality data. You'll need to:

1. Sign up for a free account
2. Get your API key
3. Add it to the project
